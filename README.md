Raindrops Game
This is a Raindrops game catcher thing where the rain (colorful ellipses) will fall and you have to move the 
catcher at the bottom of the screen and try and catch as much rain (colorful ellipses) as you can. Every time
you catch a goo raindrop, you gain a point. Everytime you catch a bad raindrop you lose a point. If you catch 
five bad raindrops, you lose and if you let five good raindrops hit the ground you lose.
